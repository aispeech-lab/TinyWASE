# TinyWASE
Implementation of our paper [Compressing Speaker Extraction Model with Ultra-low Precision Quantization and Knowledge Distillation]. 

## Getting Started
The training samples are generated by randomly selecting speeches of different speakers from *si_tr_s* of WSJ0, and mixing them at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The evaluating samples are generated by fixed list *./data/wsj/mix_2_spk_voiceP_tt_WSJ.txt*. Please modify the dataset path in *./data/preparedata.py* according to your actual path.
```python
data_config['speechWavFolderList'] = ['/home/aa/WSJ/wsj0/si_tr_s/']
data_config['spk_test_voiceP_path'] = './data/wsj/mix_2_spk_voiceP_tt_WSJ.txt'
```
You may need the command below to modify the evaluating data path.
```bash
sed -i 's/home\/aa/YOUR PATH/g' data/wsj/mix_2_spk_voiceP_tt_WSJ.txt
```
We advise you to utilize the pickle file, which could speed up experiments by saving time for frequency resampling. You could modify the pickle path to anywhere you like.
```python
data_config['train_sample_pickle'] = '/data1/haoyunzhe/interspeech/dataset/wsj0_pickle/train_sample.pickle'
data_config['test_sample_pickle'] = '/data1/haoyunzhe/interspeech/dataset/wsj0_pickle/test_sample.pickle'
```

### Training
Specify the path for --restore_teacher, --pretrained and --log in train_tinywase.py and run the bash.

```bash
python train_tinywase.py
```

### Evaluation

```bash
python eval_tinywase.py
```
