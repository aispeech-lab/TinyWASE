# TinyWASE
Pytorch implementation of our paper [Compressing Speaker Extraction Model with Ultra-low Precision Quantization and Knowledge Distillation]. 

## Getting Started
The training samples are generated by randomly selecting speeches of different speakers from *si_tr_s* of WSJ0, and mixing them at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The evaluating samples are generated by fixed list *./data/wsj/mix_2_spk_voiceP_tt_WSJ_dellnode.txt*. Please modify the dataset paths in *./data/preparedata.py* according to your actual paths.
```python
data_config['speechWavFolderList'] = ['FOLDER_TO_SPEECH_FILES']
data_config['spk_test_voiceP_path'] = 'PATH_TO_SPK_TEST_VOICEP_FILE'
```

We advise you to utilize the pickle files, which could speed up experiments by saving time for frequency resampling. You could modify the pickle paths to anywhere you like.
```python
data_config['train_sample_pickle'] = 'PATH_TO_TRAIN_SAMPLE_PICKLE'
data_config['test_sample_pickle'] = 'PATH_TO_TEST_SAMPLE_PICKLE'
```

### Training
Specify the paths for --restore_teacher, --pretrained and --log in train_tinywase.py and run the bash.

```bash
python train_tinywase.py
```

### Evaluation
Specify the paths for --restore, --log in eval_tinywase.py and run the bash.

```bash
python eval_tinywase.py
```
